                We have agreed that we all deserve the maximum amount of study points available for this assignment.<br>
                We would also like to award Patrick Johansen a study point for helping us out with our entity classes.<br>
                At last we would also like to note that we have received great help from the group consisting of Kasper, Phillip, Ã˜rvur and Mikkel.

            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <p>
                We are running tests on our Facade class and our REST services.<br>
                The REST Assured tests were not finished and has not been tested yet, therefore they cannot be run.<br>
                In our JUnit test for the Facade class, we test all our methods with the help of a test database (PU_test persistence unit).
